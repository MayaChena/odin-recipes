        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cajun Shrimp and Rice Skillet is a one-pot wonder full of flavorful shrimp and rice with a Cajun seasoning that the entire family will enjoy! “Cajun” is a word used to describe the Acadians, who were the French colonists who first settled in a region of Canada known as Acadia. Eventually, the Acadians were moved out of Canada by the British in the early 1700s and they migrated waaay down south to Louisiana. Because they didn’t have refrigerators, Cajuns learned to use every part of their animals for food and also used smoking and splicing techniques for preserving their foods. Cajun food is basically interpreted to mean “heavily seasoned” — which doesn’t always mean spicy, but often is anyway because of the heavy use of cayenne pepper in a lot of recipes.</p>

            <li>1 ⅓ cups uncooked long grain white rice</li>
