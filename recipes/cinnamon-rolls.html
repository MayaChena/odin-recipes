        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rapid rise yeast — I’d like to say I have the time to make everything solely from scratch, and either use my own starter or wait hours and hours for yeast to do it’s thing. But I don’t, so that’s where rapid rise yeast comes in so handy. The “quick” part of these homemade cinnamon rolls is all thanks to a couple packages of this little helper. Butter – I’ll just say it. BUTTER. Real butter. These are cinnamon rolls folks, indulge a little! I butter the baking dish instead of greasing with  nonstick spray and I swear it is the key to rich and fluffy cinnamon rolls! I also use plenty of butter for the filling portion of the recipe and It really makes for a truly gooey-licious cinnamon roll center.Cream cheese — I just love, love, love cream cheese icing. The slight tartness of it balances out the sweetness of the rolls and just makes them taste perfect. Leftovers — Unless you have guests or a lot of people in your family, you will probably have enough leftover rolls for breakfast tomorrow, or dessert tonight! Win-win!</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3>Dough</h3>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and butter a 9×13 inch baking pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl (or the bowl of a stand mixer) stir together 2 cups flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a glass/liquid measuring cup combine milk and butter and microwave on high for 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each, until butter is mostly melted and milk is very warm. (see note) Add milk mixture and egg to the dry ingredients and mix well. </li>
            <li>Mix in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until a shaggy dough forms. </li>
            <li>Knead for 5 minutes, then transfer to a lightly greased bowl and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Let rise for 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <h3>Rolls</h3>
            <li>Roll dough into a large rectangle (about 15×12 inches) and rub softened butter all over the top of the dough. </li>
            <li>Stir together sugar, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Sprinkle over butter, leaving about 1/2 inch around the edges bare. </li>
            <li>Tightly (but gently) roll the dough from one long side toward the other. Pinch the seam to seal off the length of the dough. </li>
            <li>Use a sharp knife or unflavored dental floss to cut into 12 equal-size pieces. Place each cut-side down in your prepared baking pan.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly and let rise in a warm dry place for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover, bake on center rack for 30-35 minutes until golden brown on the top. Allow to cool slightly before frosting. </li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <h3>Icing</h3>
            <li>In a medium sauce pan melt butter over medium-high heat. Once melted, continue to stir for 2-3 minutes longer until color changes from pale yellow to deep golden. Remove from heat. </li>
            <li>In a large bowl cream together the browned butter, cream cheese, and vanilla. </li>
            <li>Alternate mixing in 1 cup of powdered sugar and 1 tablespoon of milk until icing is smooth and fluffy. Mix in a pinch of salt for added richness, then spread over cinnamon rolls. </li>
            <li>Serve immediately or cover tightly and store at room temperature up to three days. Reheat individual rolls in the microwave for 20-30 seconds.</li>
        </ol>
